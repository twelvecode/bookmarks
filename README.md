## Directory structure

As follows:

* `app/` - This directory contains the actual Yii application (the DocumentRoot should point there).
* `lib/` - Contains libraries (TwelveCode) used by the application (including models)
* `yii/` - Contains the framework used by the application (bundled for ease)
